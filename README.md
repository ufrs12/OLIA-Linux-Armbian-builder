# OLIA-Linux Armbian builder
This builder is based on [armbian/build](https://github.com/armbian/build). Essentially, it runs [armbian/build](https://github.com/armbian/build) with the parameters necessary to build [OLIA-Linux Armbian](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA-Linux-Armbian), and also modifies Armbian for tasks that are necessary for the OLIA architecture. It can also add software products that are required in the OLIA-Linux Armbian stack and that are not in the Armbian repositories.
